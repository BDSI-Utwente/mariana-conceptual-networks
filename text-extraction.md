# Extract text from various non-standard formats

## Problem

We need to extract from user generated formats, including but not limited to .doc, .docx, .odf, .pdf, .rtf, and so forth. We can also expect to encounter different versions of these formats, created on different operating systems, with different editors.

## Approach

There are many dedicated packages for converting between specific formats. The naieve approach would be to map files to these packages.

- this is tedious, fragile, and hard to update.
