Aim and learning objective from the practicum
Expected learning objective from the student before the experiment
Expected learning objective from the student after the experiment
Learning objective fulfilled?
The aim is to determine the electromotive force (EMF) and evaluate whether (and if so, how) cation (or anion) concentration affects EMF. The learning purpose also involves building knowledge on the working principle of an electrochemical cell. Once the electrochemical cell is built, the student should correlate the EMF and determine unknown concentrations of one of the electrochemical cell components.


It is expected to deepen the understanding on galvanic cells. From the anode to cathode, the functioning of salt bridges as well as the direction flow of electrons all the while learning the variables playing a role in galvanic cells voltage such as temperature, " charge " , concentration, etc.
I expect to connect my theoretical background with the experimental.
This will ensure a graphical representation of the abstract teachings


the aim is to understand the correlation between temperature, concentration and EMF. With this you should be able to calculate one of the variable if the others are known, as is the case for the unknown CuSO4 concentration sample. 
this can all be summed up in: understanding the Nernst equation.

The learning objective is mostly fulfilled. The concentration of the unknown sample has been calculated. Most observations are as expected. 

 Introduction
As preparation,
We knew that we had to determine the EMF and that we had the materials depicted in fig 1 [1]. So the first thing that came to mind was that we needed to make a simple electrochemical cell as depicted in fig 2. What we could do now was to calculate the theoretical EMF at standard conditions since we could look up the half reactions [2][3]. 




Reduction : Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu(s) [-0.762v]
Oxidation : Zn(s) -> Zn2+ + 2e- [+0.339v]
EMF(total) = EMF(cathode) - EMF(anode) 
EMF(total) = EMF(copper) - EMF(zinc)
EMF(total) = 0.339 - (-0.762) = 1.101v 


fig 1.

fig 2. 
In the preparatory meeting,
We learned we needed to more than just make the cell. We also could vary with different concentrations ZnSO4 and CuSO4. By doing this we vary from the standard conditions. So to calculate the theoretical values we need to make use of the Nernst equation [4] .
U = U0 – (RT/nF)ln([ox]/[red]) 
In the lab,
Since there were already samples of differed CuSO4 concentration and we only had limited ZnSO4. So we only varied with the CuSO4 concentrations. There also was a hot plate were I have done one experiment on, to measure the temperature dependence of the reaction.

Graphical representation of the conceptual model and the narratives
The chemical Cell will work as depicted in fig 3. 
fig 3. 
With the standard potential [3]:
Zn(s)"ZnSO4(aq)""CuSO4(aq)"Cu(s)
Reduction : Cu2+ + 2e- -> Cu(s) [-0.762v]
Oxidation : Zn(s) -> Zn2+ + 2e- [+0.339v]
EMF(total) = EMF(cathode) - EMF(anode) 
EMF(total) = EMF(copper) - EMF(zinc)
EMF(total) = 0.339 - (-0.762) = 1.101v

Were we can calculate the nonstandard potential with the Nernst equation [4]:

With Qr = [Zn2+]/[Cu2+]


With the changing variables:
- Concentration
- Temperature
- Voltage measurement
- Mass of Cu and Zn
Of witch we can measure Temperature, voltage, mass and can calculate a theoretical concentration.

Questions based on observation
1, the measuring of the voltage of the electrochemical cell with differed concentrations of CuSO4.

1, see table 1. And fig 4. 
1, are the measurements similar to the theoretical values? If not how much do thy deviate from the theoretical values? And why do thy deviate?

Questions based on observation
Overarching question
1.measuring the voltage of different consecrations 
1. Table 1. The voltage of concertation 0.0000 M
1. Why is the voltage of the 0.0000 M concertation higher than the 0.0010 M? (in contradiction with the Nernst equation)
1.Am I wrong or the Nernst equation?
2.measuring the voltage with increasing temperature (equal consecrations)
2. Fig 3. The increase of voltage with an increase of temperature.
2. Why does the voltage increase with temperature? (in contradiction with the Nernst equation). 
What is the correlation of temperature to voltage?
2. Am I wrong or the Nernst equation?
3.weihing the copper and zinc
3. Table 2. The difference in weight bevor and after the lab.
3. Why has the zinc increase in weight and copper a decrease? (in contradiction whit the conceptual model)
3.Am I wrong or the conceptual model?
Table 4.
After the meeting with the learning assistant
Table 4: 
1, The higher voltage at 0M is probably due to an error. The most probable reason for this error is that I had done the 0M measurement last (because I only came up later to do it). Since the ends of the salt bridge were quite absorbent it could have absorbed some of the higher concentrations CuSO4 from the previous experiments. Thus increasing the concentration CuSO4 of the 0M demi water. This hypothesis gets further strengthened with fig 6. And fig 7. were in fig 6. the tips of the salt bridge can be seen unused at the beginning of the lab. In fig 7. the tips of the salt bridge can be seen before the 0M experiment. As one might notice the right tip is moor blue in fig 7. than in fig 6. Meaning some of the bleu colored CuSO4 is absorbed by the tip bevor the 0M experiment.
fig 6. fig 7.

2, this result is unexpected. My hypothesis was that with equal concentrations it would be temperature independent. Since in the Nernst equation the temperature variable is dependent on the ln([ox]/[red]) term. With equal concentration this would be 0.
U = U0 – (RT/nF)ln([ox]/[red]) if [ox] and [red] are equal 
U = U0 – (RT/nF)ln(x/x) x/x is 1 
U = U0 – (RT/nF)ln(1) ln(1) is 0
U = U0 – (RT/nF)*0 meaning:
U = U0 independent of T
However, this was not the result. As seen in fig 5. there is a rather strong correlation between temperature and voltage. Because of the amount of measurements it would be unreasonable to blame some kind of error for this. That means something worst be wrong in the equation. When reading [4] it is explained that the Nernst equation we have used is a simplified version. The real equation is: U = U0 – (RT/nF)ln(activity ox/activity red). But because the activity is largely dependent on concentration it is often simplified to U = U0 – (RT/nF)ln([ox]/[red]). However when using equal concentrations the activity of Zn and Cu does chance depending on temperature. And because Cu chances differently from the same temperature difference than Zn we don't end up dividing equal numbers meaning the T will not be canceled out of the equation.
3, The weight differences in the Zn bar and Cu bar (table 2.) are exactly opposed of what I expected. But because we are talking about 2 single measurements with only 0.01g difference I think it is reasonable to believe this is due to a small inaccuracy of the scale or some other small error.
Table 3:
1, the values do follow the same trend as the Nernst equation would suggest. However all the values are a bit lower than calculated. This is not to surprising since the Nernst equation suggest ''ideal conditions'' witch we don't have in the real word. One of the reasons could be the way I sealed of the tips of the salt bridge see fig 6. This causes resistance.

 2, normally we use spectrometry to determine unknown concentrations. But this time we had not spectrometer at our disposal. but even if we did we would still depend on beer lambert's law withs becomes really inaccurate at higher concentrations. But luckily we can also use the Nernst equation. We can do this in 2 ways. We can look at the temperature dependence since that changes depending on ln([Zn2+]/[Cu2+]) but this is a bit of a cumbersome method. Because we would need to make an entire graph of the temperature dependence. Also we use a simplified Nernst equation as in the more precise equation the activity changes with temperature. Meaning it also is not the most precise method. The easier method is to just measure the voltage at a constant temperature. Now because all other variable are known you we can calculate the concentration:
U = U0 – (RT/nF) 
([Zn2+]/[Cu2+]) = e^(-nF(U-U0)/RT)
[Cu2+] = [Zn2+]*(e^(-nF(U-U0)/RT))
Unknown sample (1.0910V):
[Cu2+] = 0.1*(e^(-2*96 485.3329 (1.0910 - 1.101)/ 8.314 462 618*294.15)) = 0.2201
so it should be 0.2201M but because all the voltages are a bit lower than the Nernst equation would suggest the concentration will be a bit lower. 





CM0 (before the practicum). 
CM1 (after the practicum and meeting with the learning assistant)
Fig 5. The temperature dependence of equal concentration
As already explained this is because a simplified Nernst equation was used 

A new CM called CM2
With the addition of the fact that a simplified Nernst equation was used there are no observations that would suggest a chance or addition of the first conceptual model.
