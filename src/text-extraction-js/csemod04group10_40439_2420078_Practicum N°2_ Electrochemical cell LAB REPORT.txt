Introduction The goal of this assignment is to determine the cell potential of a Daniell cell with varying concentrations of Cu2+ and [ ( )"  2  4 ( )""  2  4 ( )" ( )] interpret the results. In addition we have also experimented with increasing temperature and weight differences before and after the lab. The cell potential is measured with the help of a voltmeter, the experimental setup is depicted in the Conceptual Model. The working principle of a voltmeter is as follows: The voltmeter possesses a core at its middle adjacent to two permanent natural magnets and is held by two springs, this core is mobile and holds a coil inside of it, the contraption is directly attached to the pointer which we use to read the voltage measurement. The core movement is caused by the flow of direct current from the galvanic cell through the coil. This induces a perpendicular magnetic field to the current flow. The magnetic field causes torque in the springs which rotates the pointer to the correct position . The voltmeter will help us read the voltage measurements throughout the experiments. [5] Picture of inside a voltmeter 3. Conceptual Model The aim of this assignment is to build a specific galvanic cell where zinc metal is oxidized at the anode and copper(2+) is reduced at the cathode. This cell is commonly referred as the Daniell cell with the following cell notation : . [ ( )"  2  4 ( )""  2  4 ( )" ( )] At the anode a Zinc metal plate submerged in ZnSO4 solution [0.01M] is used and at the cathode we have a copper metal plate immersed in various CuSO4 solutions with varying concentration. The anode and the cathode are connected in series with a voltmeter, where electrons flow from the anode to cathode. Lastly, the cell charge is maintained with the help of a salt bridge, filled with a saturated KCl solution prepared at the lab as illustrated below: We utilised the Nernst equation : = º ln ( ) Where : R = 8.314J*/(K*mol) ( Gas constant R ) T = 298K ( temperature in Kelvin ) Z = 2 ( number of participating electrons ) F = 96485 sA/mol ( Faraday constant) Qr = [Zn2+]/[Cu2+] ( reaction quotient) With this equation and the available measuring devices, we could change the following variables throughout the experiments. Cu(2+) Concentration at the cathode Temperature Stirring intensity We expect the voltage to increase if the Cu(2+) concentration increases; the reaction constant will be negative if the Cu2+ concentration is higher than that of the Zn2+ resulting in a voltage increase. The temperature might increase or decrease the voltage depending on the reaction quotient. If the reaction constant yields a negative value ( Cu2+ » Zn2+ ) then a higher temperature will result in a higher voltage reading. If the reaction constant yields a positive value ( Cu2+ « Zn2+ ) then a higher temperature will result in a lower voltage. Furthermore, a minimal mass accumulation on the copper cathode followed by a mass depletion on the zinc anode is expected. 4. Results and discussion Potential at different concentrations: The group built an electrochemical cell and measured the potential of this one at different concentrations of copper sulfate. The Nernst equation advises that the potential of the cell will go higher for higher concentrations of copper sulfate, and at the same concentration between zinc sulfate and copper sulfate the standard potential should be measured. Table 1 will show the values of all group members prior to taking the average of the three, the statistical results for the group report will be shown in Table 2, where the statistical values of all 3 members will be compared to the expected theoretical values Table 1. CuSO4 concentration (M / 25°C) ZnSO4 concentration (M / 25°C) Potential (V / 25°C) Julien Potential (V / 25°C) Jaap Potential (V / 25°C) Kevin 0.000 0.100 / 1.0563 / 0.001 0.100 1.0427 1.0356 1.0707 0.030 0.100 1.0479 1.0729 1.0920 0.100 0.100 1.0384* 1.0875 1.1011 0.300 0.100 1.0510 1.0905 1.1260 1.402 (saturated) 0.100 1.0814 1.0988 1.1284 unknown 0.100 1.0767 1.0910 1.1011 *Value measured is abnormally lower than the one prior, and will have effects in Table 2 but it was decided that it was best to keep it since the average value without it would also be abnormal compared to the rest. Table 2. CuSO4 concentration (M / 25°C) ZnSO4 concentration (M / 25°C) Experimental Potential (V / 25°C) Theoretical Potential (V / 25°C) 0.000 0.100 1.0563* / 0.001 0.100 1.0496 1.0409 0.030 0.100 1.0709 1.0845 0.100 0.100 1.0757 1.1000 0.300 0.100 1.0892 1.1141 1.402 (saturated) 0.100 1.1029 1.1339 unknown 0.100 1.0896 / *Only one student realised this measurement, therefore the value does not fit ideally in the table as not enough students participated in the measurement. Determination of the concentration of the unknown sample: One of the main goals of the experiment was to determine the concentration of a sample of copper sulfate with an unknown concentration. Normally, spectroscopy would be used to determine concentration of an unknown sample, but this one wasn't on the material list. Furthermore with spectroscopy we would be dependent on the beer Lambert's law which becomes inaccurate at higher concentrations. To solve this problem the Nernst equation will be used. 2 different methods are possible. Firstly, the temperature dependence since that changes depending on ,but ( 2+ 2+ ) this would lead to complex calculations, and also does not fit with the results obtained as the temperature was barely changed. Because of that the concentration dependency over the potential will be used. A simplified Nernst equation will be used as the temperature will be neglected. This makes the method used imprecise, but the temperature couldn't be kept constant during the experiment. The optimal method would be to measure the potential at a constant temperature. Now because all other variable are known you we can calculate the concentration: = ° ( *  *  ) * ( [ 2+ ] [ 2+ ] ) ( [ 2+ ] [ 2+ ] ) =  ( * ( °) *  ) [ 2+ ] = [ 2+ ]  ( * ( °) *  ) Table 3. Student Unknown sample's Potential (V) Calculated concentration of copper sulfate (M / L) Julien 1.0767 0.0151 Kevin 1.1011 0.1008 Jaap 1.0910 0.0459 Average: / 0.0539 Changes in mass before and after the experiment of the metal strips: Table 4. Jaap Julien Weight (g) Before After Before After N°1 After N°2 Copper 5.39 5.38 6.50692 6.50646 6.50617 Zinc 5.32 5.33 5.30252 5.30274 5.30279 Average difference: Copper Zinc - 0.00537 g + 0.0005135 g If the electrochemical cell works as shown in the conceptual model, zinc atoms will convert to zinc ions (thus decreasing the mass of the zinc electrode) and copper ions will convert to copper atoms (thus increasing the mass of the copper electrode). However it is noteworthy that the weight differences in the Zn bar and Cu bar in Table 4 have the exact opposite results of what is expected. But because there are only 4 measurements with only 0.01g difference We think it is reasonable to believe this is due to a small inaccuracy of the scale or some other small error such as dirtiness for example, or not enough cleaning after and before the use. Temperature dependency on the potential: Figure 1. Cell potential as a function of the temperature. Measured values in red dots. Curve fitting red line The results in Figure 1 were not as expected. The hypothesis was that with equal concentrations it would be temperature independent. Since in the Nernst equation the temperature variable is dependent on the ln([ox]/[red]) term. With equal concentration this would be 0. = ° ( *  *  ) * ( [ ] [ ] ), [ ] [ ]  = ° ( *  *  ) * (1), (1) = 0 = ° * 0 = °, . However, this was not the result. As seen in Figure 3. there is a rather strong correlation between temperature and voltage. Because of the amount of data points it would not be reasonable to blame some sort of error for this. That means something must be wrong in the equation. When reading, it was found that the Nernst equation used is a simplified version. The real equation is: [3]. = ° ( *  *  ) * (     ) Because the activity is largely dependent on concentration it is often simplified to = ° ( *  *  ) * ( [ ] [ ] ) However when using equal concentrations the activity of Zn and Cu does chance depending on temperature. And because Cu changes differently from the same temperature difference than Zn, the ration inside the logarithm ends up not being equal to 1, adding a dependency to temperature regarding the concentration. 5. Error discussion It was expected for the potentials (Table 1 & 2) to be similar to the theoretical values calculated with the following equation: : = ° ( *  *  ) * (  4 [  4 ] ) , ° =   : 2+ + 2  > ( ) [ 0. 762 ] : ( ) > 2+ + 2  [+ 0. 339 ]   =       =       = 0. 339 ( 0. 762) = 1. 101  The values do follow the same trend as the Nernst equation would suggest. However the values are a bit lower than the theoretical values. This can be explained by a variety of reasons, the main one being that the Nernst equation suggests ''ideal conditions'' which we couldn't assure during the experiments. Other reasons could be for example, the way the tips of the salt bridge were sealed off (see Figure 1). This caused a change in the resistance and affected the measured potential of the voltmeter. Figure 2. Setup of the Daniel cell prior to the experiment. As may be noticed in Table 1. The voltage at [CuSO4 ] = 0.000M is higher than the voltage at 0.001M. this is not consistent with the trend the Nernst equation suggests. Therefore the higher voltage at 0M is probably due to an error. The most probable reason for this error is that the student did the 0M measurement at last. Since the ends of the salt bridge were quite absorbent it could have absorbed some of the higher concentrations CuSO4 from the previous experiments. This results in an increase in the concentration of CuSO4 when using demi water. This hypothesis gets further strengthened when comparing Figure 2 And Figure 3, where in Figure 2 the tips of the salt bridge can be seen unused prior to the experiment. In fig 2, whereas in Figure 3, the tips of the salt bridge can be seen tainted in blue indicating the presence of copper sulfate before the 0M experiment. Figure 3. Setup of the Daniel cell after the experiment. Other sources of potential errors: the fluctuation of the voltmeter. The voltmeter did not give one accurate value at every measurement and the oven fluctuated a bit. the use of a non digital tenomether. This ment we needed to read off the temperature values with the naked eye. This couldn't really give us more than one decimal of precision. During the temperature dependency experiment it is important that both solutions' temperatures are equal all the time. In reality the temperature can't be 100% equal all the time with the material that was given. 6. Commentary We managed to do the requested experiments in time and even add some additional experiments with temperature and weight. However there are still things that we have not experimented with. For example: The effect of the gel on the potential The effect of stirring the solutions during the experiment The effect when heating only one of the solutions and keeping the other one constant Those are experiments that we were not able to realise with the time given or the material provided, although they would definitely be experiments realized if the opportunity would come. 7. Conclusion The simplified Nernst equation is a good tool to approximate the dependence of temperature, concentration and voltage in electrochemical cells, but it will be considered as an approximation for the following two reasons. Firstly, the Nernst equation works with ''ideal conditions'' that we don't have in the real world. Because of this the real values will always be a bit lower than the calculated values. Also we have made use of a simplified Nernst equation [3]. As the real equation uses activity instead of concentration. These activities are dependent on temperature, consecration and the used substance. 8. Recommendations The new approach to labs is definitely an improvement. It forces the students to understand the subject both in theory and practice since they need to make their own experimental setup beforehand. Compared to having everything given beforehand, this method makes the students put more effort into their work. The freedom given during the preparation and the experiment itself is also very appreciated, even though there often is a set of mandatory given experiments to do, students are free to do other experiments with the materials given. This stimulates the curiosity and knowledge on the subject. However the appendix for both lab journal and report are still a bit hard to understand and get the hang off, while the structure is very similar to the past lab journal, there are some parts that are still not understood completely. The following are some example of unclear statement about the lab journal / report as of now: Although there was a conference giving feedback on how the conceptual models should be developed, it is quite hard to follow the structure. If no inconsistencies are found then it is very difficult to follow the structure in the appendix Why are we forced to put everything in tables, especially in the lab journal. Tables are meant to make things clearer. However, we are forced to put 4 different statements on the way you interpret the goal of the experiment in a conjoined table table, and you end up with a really big table with sentences of only 2 or 3 words. The structure of the appendix feels like it's missing some initial parts, for instance, at certain moment parts of the experiment or hypothesis need to be cited, adding a measurement procedure where the parts of the experiment would be explained in detail and the hypothesis will be drawn would be a nice addition. In conclusion, the changes to the lab procedure is a great and nicely inputted addition, although the journal structure could get some more addition or clarification. Perhaps the structure does not need any change but a better adaptation from the student.. 9.
